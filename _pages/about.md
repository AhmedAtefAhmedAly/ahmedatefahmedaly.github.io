I am a computer vision master student at <a href='https://mbzuai.ac.ae/'> MBZUAI </a>  specializing in medical imaging. My current research focus on foundation models and vision-language models for healthcare applications. My current research centers on echocardiography, where I explore test-time prompt tuning and continual learning methods that support robust adaptation in real clinical environments. 

Looking forward, I aim to continue working in research and development roles where I can contribute to building the next generation of medical foundation models and deployable AI systems for patient care.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
